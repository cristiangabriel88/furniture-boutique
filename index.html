        TAILORED FOR YOU <br />
        There are countless elements that make you, uniquely you. And we love
        helping you express your identity through our highly customisable
        collection. Not just sofas, we can change the size, configuration,
        colours and materials of nearly every design. It’s all about helping you
        create a truly personal home that matches your style, budget and the way
        you live. So more than 80% of our collection can be altered for size,
        component, colour or material. From a sofa’s legs and armrests, to the
        size of your dining table, or the configuration of your new wall system.

        PERSONAL FURNITURE <br />Creating custom furniture is very close to our
        heart and concept. Our concept is all about you, your world and your exciting,
        personal taste. That’s why we’re creating design pieces with personal
        freedom. Express your tastes by designing a custom sofa, by designing
        your own media unit, by having our interior designers tailor furniture
        to your home and create a bespoke, personal solution. It’s functional
        design furniture that adapts to your life. Your freedom of expression is
        also found in our range of over a hundred luxury fabrics and leathers.
        Choose from a variety of hues and finishes. From on-trend velvet,
        corduroy and other tactile structures, to exclusive pure aniline leather
        and Italian lambswool felt. So start designing, optimising, combining
        and personalising – we’re ready with your bespoke furniture solution.

    <h2 >How it works</h2>
    <main id="steps">
      <div class="step one">
        <img src="./resources/images/work0.jpg" />
        <p>
          <strong>STEP 1: STYLE SELECTION</strong><br> Step one is about finding the shape and style
          you like. If it’s a sofa you are looking for, check out the sofa
          overview, where we have a curated selection of our sofa designs.
          Whether it’s curved or straight, sharp lines or soft shapes – here is
          your overview of sofa systems to fit any contemporary taste. Choose
          your favourite design – maybe it’s the Osaka collection – and you’re
          ready for the next step. If you are looking for a dining chair, it’s
          the same process; go to the overview page, find your favourite
          collection and get ready to make it your own.
        </p>

      <div class="step two">
        <img src="./resources/images/work2.jpg" />
        <p>
        <strong>STEP 2: MEASUREMENTS AND SIZE</strong><br> Once you have found a design you love,
          its time to make sure it fits your home. Remember that we are not able
          to show everything online - but if you have your heart set on a
          specific piece, check the product details to find all relevant
          measurements. If you are in doubt, visit us and have a talk with our
          talented team members on how to integrate and optimise your space.
          Once you have the perfectly sized designer piece, you’re on to step 3
          where you indulge in fine materials and exciting colours.

        <p>
        <strong>STEP 3: MATERIALS AND FABRICS</strong><br>Whether you have your heart set on a
          dining chair, sofa or table - the task is alike; It’s time for colours
          and surfaces. Here on our website you can start playing around and
          design your own sofa, choose the right colour of fronts on the custom
          wall unit and make the designs fit your personal style. Want to feel
          the touch of our quality leather in person – visit a store and get
          first-hand experience along with guidance from our talented interior
          designers.

         <br />One of the things we enjoy most about our business is
        that each piece of wooden furniture we create is as unique as the
        customers who ordered it. We love hearing the excitement in someone’s
        voice as they explain their idea to us and are equally excited to help
        bring that vision to life. Whether you’re looking to create a very
        specific piece or need a solution for an awkward area, our team can
        help. Shoot us an email, give us a call or pop by our beautiful showroom
        and let’s get started!<br>
